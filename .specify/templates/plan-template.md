# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: JavaScript/TypeScript
**Primary Dependencies**: wrangler
**Storage**: [e.g., Workers KV, D1, R2 or N/A]
**Testing**: [e.g., vitest, jest or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Target Platform**: Cloudflare Workers
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Principle 1: Cloudflare-First Development**: Does the proposed solution use Cloudflare Workers for all backend services and APIs?
- **Principle 2: API-Driven Design**: Is the design based on the API documentation in `doc/沙箱 API 文件`? Have any necessary updates to the API documentation been planned?
- **Principle 3: Stateless and Scalable**: Is the architecture stateless? If not, is state management handled by an appropriate external service (e.g., Workers KV, D1)?
- **Principle 4: Asynchronous and Event-Driven**: Does the design favor asynchronous communication patterns and event-driven architecture where practical?

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
